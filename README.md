We are dedicated to creating advanced technological solutions to address everyday challenges. One of our innovations is **Tokyo Fire Fighter Mobil**, a smart firefighting vehicle powered by **Internet of Things (IoT)** technology, designed to deliver a rapid response to fire emergencies.  

## **Project Description**  

**Tokyo Fire Fighter Mobil** is an intelligent vehicle equipped with:  
- **Fire sensors** for accurate fire detection.  
- **ESP microcontroller** enabling Wi-Fi connectivity, allowing the vehicle to be controlled via the **Tokyo Control** application.  

The vehicle is designed to operate in both automatic and manual modes, offering flexibility in its operation. Its key features include:  
- **Automatic Operation**: The vehicle autonomously approaches the fire source and activates the water pump to extinguish the flames.  
- **Manual Control**: Users can control the vehicleâ€™s movement (forward, backward, right, left) via the application connected to the **Firebase Realtime Database**.  

The system is also equipped with:  
- **Automatic Servo**:  
  - Directs the fire extinguisher hose to the fire source.  
  - Activates the water pump to efficiently spray water.  
- **Relay** for controlling the pump and other devices.  

## **Features**  

- **Automatic Fire Detection**: Uses fire sensors to locate fire sources accurately.  
- **Remote Control**: The **Tokyo Control** application provides full remote control of the vehicle via a Wi-Fi connection.  
- **Integrated Servo**: Controls the fire extinguisher hose to ensure efficient fire suppression.  
- **Reliable Relay**: Manages the operation of the water pump.  
- **IoT Connectivity**: Utilizes Wi-Fi for seamless integration with cloud systems through **Firebase**.  

## **Our Vision**  

Through **Tokyo Fire Fighter Mobil**, we aim to deliver an innovative solution for firefighting. By combining automation technology and remote control, this project is designed to enhance safety, provide a quick response, and maintain peace of mind during critical situations.  

We believe that technology can drive positive change, and we are committed to continuous innovation for a safer and smarter future.
